# COMP30020-Proj1
Project 1 for Computer Systems at The University of Melbourne, 2018 Semester 1.

The project was to create a simple multithreaded server in C that could serve simple GET requests.
Any other requests are discarded.

Usage:
Compile the file with `make`
`./server <port number> <home directory>`

You can use the `test` folder to try serving requests.

The `test_script.sh` was a bash script provided to us to test the server.

Feel free to give it a go! :muscle:
